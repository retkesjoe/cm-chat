Improvements ideas:
  ☐ Setup path aliases.
  ☐ Setup Jest for unit testing.
  ☐ Setup Cypress for E2E testing.
  ☐ Install storybook for building UI components and pages in isolation.
  ☐ Write stories, unit tests, and E2E tests.
  ☐ Refactor the Chat component. I don't really like using messages state there.
  ☐ Create a splash screen where the user can give their username.
  ☐ Create a sidebar for different chat rooms.
  ☐ Give opportunity for the users to create, read update, delete chat rooms.
